"Adaptive Vision-Language Robot Learning for Manipulation Tasks"- a system that combines vision transformers and language models to enable robots to learn manipulation tasks from natural language instructions and visual demonstrations. The system would use a memory-efficient architecture to run on edge devices.

The project combines three key technical innovations:

1. A memory-efficient vision transformer for processing robot camera feeds in real-time
2. A lightweight multimodal architecture that connects visual understanding with language commands
3. A reinforcement learning layer that optimizes the robot's movements based on real-world feedback

The practical implementation would include:

Week 1: Developing the core vision system and basic manipulation pipeline
Week 2: Implementing language-vision integration for command interpretation
Week 3: Adding reinforcement learning capabilities and real-world optimization
(Week 4 if available: Expanding the task repertoire and improving robustness)
