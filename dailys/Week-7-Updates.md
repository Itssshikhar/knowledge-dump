### Something Fundamental that I learned

- After taking to a bunch of people there is very less awareness about profiling and optimization.
- Even if someone has already launched your before you, they'll probably screw up. Most founders do. It boils down to execution and distribution.
- Having a deep chat with co-founder (distillation guy) is essential for startup to pan out.
