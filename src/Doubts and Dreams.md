In the corner dim-lit, where her realm cultivates,
She sat-book cracked, screen anticipates,
Her fingers trembling on scattered memories of collection,
But for each fragment of an unravelling self.

Reading-oh reading! Not for punishment, but for pleasure,
The stories were bleak, though full of isolation,
Airpods lost, like the whispers in fog
Yet, the corner remains her only venture
